# Solutions Engineer | Backend & Data-Driven Systems


I build and integrate complex backend systems, mainly around databases, data pipelines, and automation.
Day-to-day I work with SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, writing advanced SQL, procedures, and ETL flows, and solving production issues end-to-end.

Strong background in Python & Java, with experience across scripting, system integration, and problem-solving in constrained environments.
